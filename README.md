# KRNN Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

KRNN Stock Price Prediction is a project that leverages the **K Rare-class Nearest Neighbour Classification (KRNN)** algorithm to predict stock prices using time-series data from the NASDAQ 100. Inspired by the research paper "[KRNN: k Rare-class Nearest Neighbour Classification](#)" by Xiuzhen Zhang et al., this project implements a modified version of Microsoft's Qlib [`pytorch_krnn.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib) to address the challenges of imbalanced classification in financial data.

## Features

- **Time-Series Cross-Validation:** Utilizes `TimeSeriesSplit` to maintain temporal order in training and testing.
- **Data Scaling:** Implements proper scaling within each cross-validation fold to prevent data leakage.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains the KRNN model and evaluates it using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
- **Plot Generation:** Saves plots of predictions vs. actual values and training/validation loss over epochs.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging to monitor the training process and debug if necessary.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
